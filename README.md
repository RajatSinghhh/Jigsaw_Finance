| ID  | Severity | Title                                                             |
|-----|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | High     | ETH Transfer via `_handleETHDeposit()` Fails Due to Payability Mismatch |
| 2   | Medium   | Lack of Minimum Deposit Threshold Enables Dust-Griefing in `deposit()` |
| 3   | [Optional: Add more here] | [Optional: Description] |

## 📂 Detailed Findings

### 1. ETH Transfer via `_handleETHDeposit()` Fails Due to Payability Mismatch

- **File:** `GatewaySend.sol:277`
- **Description:**  
  A low-level call is made to `gateway.depositAndCall{value: amount}(...)`, but the target function is not marked `payable`, leading to transaction reverts.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Mark `depositAndCall()` as `payable` or refactor logic to avoid unnecessary ETH transfer.

---

### 2. Lack of Minimum Deposit Threshold Enables Dust‑Griefing in `HoldingManager.deposit()`

- **File:** `HoldingManager.sol`
- **Description:**  
  Allows arbitrarily small token deposits (e.g., 1 wei), enabling griefing via storage/event spam that increases gas costs.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Introduce a minimum threshold to reject dust transactions.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Mark functions correctly as `payable` where applicable.
- Add minimum token amount checks to critical deposit methods.
- Consider implementing circuit breakers or rate-limiting to prevent abuse.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Manual Review
- Foundry / Hardhat Testing (optional)
- Slither / MythX / Custom Scripts (if used)
