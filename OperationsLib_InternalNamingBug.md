# Naming Convention Violation in `getFeeAbsolute` Function (OperationsLib.sol)

## Summary
The function `getFeeAbsolute` in the `OperationsLib` library is marked `internal` but does not follow the Solidity naming convention of prefixing internal functions with an underscore (`_`).

## Finding Description
In Solidity, it's common practice to name `internal` functions with a leading underscore (e.g., `_getFeeAbsolute`) to clearly distinguish them from `external` or `public` functions. This convention improves code readability and helps developers quickly understand visibility and intended use.

However, in `OperationsLib`, the function is declared as:

```solidity
function getFeeAbsolute(...) internal returns (...) {
    ...
}
```

This breaks the naming consistency expected in professional Solidity codebases. It can lead to confusion during code maintenance, auditing, or when developers are navigating the call structure.

## Impact Explanation
While this issue does **not break functionality**, it weakens **code clarity and maintainability**, especially in libraries used by multiple contracts. If the project maintains a style guide or is meant to scale with many contributors, inconsistent naming can cause friction and technical debt.

## Likelihood Explanation
The likelihood is **high** from a developer/maintainer perspective because internal functions are frequently referenced within the library and consuming contracts. The confusion or oversight stemming from misnamed functions is likely in larger teams or during upgrades.

## Proof of Concept
Consider the following declaration:

```solidity
function getFeeAbsolute(uint256 amount, uint256 feeBps) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return (amount * feeBps) / 10_000;
}
```

This should follow convention and be renamed to:

```solidity
function _getFeeAbsolute(uint256 amount, uint256 feeBps) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return (amount * feeBps) / 10_000;
}
```

## Recommendation
Rename the internal function to follow Solidity naming conventions:

```solidity
function _getFeeAbsolute(uint256 amount, uint256 feeBps) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return (amount * feeBps) / 10_000;
}
```

Following consistent naming helps maintain clean and predictable code, reducing the cognitive load during reviews, audits, or onboarding new developers.
